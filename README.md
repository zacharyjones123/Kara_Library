# Kara_Library
This project is meant to be a library program that Kara can run in her classroom and for personal use so she can see what books she has currently and what books she needs. This is also useful for her to know what books she has even when she is at home lesson planning at night. Student will be able to check out books using a bar code scanner that we put on each book.
